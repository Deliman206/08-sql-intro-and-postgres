  // GET is the READ portion of CRUD. This is a request and response to the server i.e.  #1, #2 and #5 on the diagram. This is reading a route for new HTML to /new HTML where we create new articles. This interacts with submitting a new article form to the server and the submit button executes the method insertRecord in article.js. The submit button event listener is turned on when the new.html has loaded. Then when the event fires av.submit goes onto the stack (this is a promise) and calls a.insertRecord which then calls app.post to update the server with the new article.
